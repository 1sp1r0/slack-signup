[![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/jumbosushi/slack-signup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jumbosushi/slack-signup)

Online signup page for [Slack](https://slack.com/) via [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)!

Inspired by https://levels.io/slack-typeform-auto-invite-sign-ups/

I will make a node version of slack-typeform signup web app
*UPDATE: Back end works! Need front end now :rocket:*
